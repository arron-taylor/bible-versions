      "22": "Nor does anyone pour new wine into used wineskins, because the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins.\"",
      "23": "Jesus was walking through some wheat fields on a Sabbath. As his disciples walked along with him, they began to pick the heads of wheat.",
      "24": "So the Pharisees said to Jesus, \"Look, it is against our Law for your disciples to do that on the Sabbath!\"",
      "25": "Jesus answered, \"Have you never read what David did that time when he needed something to eat? He and his men were hungry,",
      "26": "so he went into the house of God and ate the bread offered to God. This happened when Abiathar was the High Priest. According to our Law only the priests may eat this bread--but David ate it and even gave it to his men.\"",
      "27": "And Jesus concluded, \"The Sabbath was made for the good of human beings; they were not made for the Sabbath.",

      "16": "For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.",
      "17": "And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is a delusion and you are still lost in your sins.",
      "18": "It would also mean that the believers in Christ who have died are lost.",
      "19": "If our hope in Christ is good for this life only and no more, then we deserve more pity than anyone else in all the world.",

      "36": "You fool! When you plant a seed in the ground, it does not sprout to life unless it dies.",
      "37": "And what you plant is a bare seed, perhaps a grain of wheat or some other grain, not the full-bodied plant that will later grow up.",
      "38": "God provides that seed with the body he wishes; he gives each seed its own proper body.",
      "39": "And the flesh of living beings is not all the same kind of flesh; human beings have one kind of flesh, animals another, birds another, and fish another.",
      "40": "And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; the beauty that belongs to heavenly bodies is different from the beauty that belongs to earthly bodies.",
      "41": "The sun has its own beauty, the moon another beauty, and the stars a different beauty; and even among stars there are different kinds of beauty.",
      "42": "This is how it will be when the dead are raised to life. When the body is buried, it is mortal; when raised, it will be immortal.",
      "43": "When buried, it is ugly and weak; when raised, it will be beautiful and strong.",
      "44": "When buried, it is a physical body; when raised, it will be a spiritual body. There is, of course, a physical body, so there has to be a spiritual body.",
      "45": "For the scripture says, \"The first man, Adam, was created a living being\"; but the last Adam is the life-giving Spirit.",
      "46": "It is not the spiritual that comes first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.",
      "47": "The first Adam, made of earth, came from the earth; the second Adam came from heaven.",
      "48": "Those who belong to the earth are like the one who was made of earth; those who are of heaven are like the one who came from heaven.",
      "49": "Just as we wear the likeness of the man made of earth, so we will wear the likeness of the Man from heaven.",
      "50": "What I mean, friends, is that what is made of flesh and blood cannot share in God's Kingdom, and what is mortal cannot possess immortality.",
      "53": "For what is mortal must be changed into what is immortal; what will die must be changed into what cannot die.",
