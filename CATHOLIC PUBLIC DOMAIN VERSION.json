      "45": "And he changed his name and called him, in the Egyptian tongue: ‘Savior of the world.’ And he gave him as a wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis. And so Joseph went out into the land of Egypt.",

      "48": "And now all the abundance of grain was stored away in every city.",
      "49": "And there was such a great abundance of wheat that it was comparable to the sands of the sea, and its bounty exceeded all measure.",

      "51": "And he called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “God has caused me to forget all my labors and the house of my father.”",
      "52": "Likewise, he named the second Ephraim, saying, “God has caused me to increase in the land of my poverty.”",

And so it was not known wherein lay his strength.",

Reveal with what you ought to be bound.” And Samson responded to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with a loom, and if you tie these around a spike and fix it to the ground, I will be weak.”",

      "3": "And the king said to them, “I saw a dream, and, being confused in mind, I do not know what I saw.”",
      "4": "And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac, “O king, live forever. Tell the dream to your servants, and we will reveal its interpretation.”",

      "6": "But if you explain the dream and its meaning, you will receive from me rewards, and gifts, and great honor. Therefore, reveal to me the dream and its interpretation.”",

      "8": "The king answered and said, “I am certain that you are stalling for time because you know that the memory of it has slipped away from me.",
      "9": "Therefore, if you do not reveal to me the dream, there is only one conclusion to be reached about you, that the interpretation is likewise false, and packed full of deception, so as to speak before me until the time passes away. And so, tell me the dream, so that I will also know that the interpretation that you tell me is likewise true.”",
      "10": "Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and they said, “There is no man on earth who can accomplish your word, O king. For neither has any king, however great and mighty, asked for an answer of this kind from every seer, and astrologer, and Chaldean.",
      "11": "For the answer that you seek, O king, is very difficult. Neither can anyone be found who can reveal it in the sight of the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.”",

      "15": "And he asked him, who had received the orders of the king, for what reason such a cruel sentence had gone forth from the face of the king. And so, when Arioch had revealed the matter to Daniel,",
      "16": "Daniel went in and asked of the king that he would grant him time to reveal the solution to the king.",
      "17": "And he went into his house and explained the task to Hananiah, and Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,",
      "18": "so that they would seek mercy before the face of the God of heaven, about this mystery, and so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the other wise men of Babylon.",

      "34": "And so you looked until a stone was broken off without hands from a mountain, and it struck the statue on its feet, which were of iron and clay, and it shattered them.",
      "35": "Then the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold were crushed together and diminished like the ashes of a summer courtyard, and they were quickly taken away by the wind, and no place was found for them; but the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.",
      "36": "This is the dream; we will also tell its interpretation before you, O king.",
      "37": "You are a king among kings, and the God of heaven has given to you a kingdom, and fortitude, and power, and glory,",
      "38": "and all the places wherein the sons of men and the beasts of the field dwell. He has likewise given the flying creatures of the air into your hand, and he has placed all things under your realm. Therefore, you are the head of gold.",
      "40": "And the fourth kingdom will be like iron. Just as iron shatters and conquers all things, so will it shatter and crush all these.",
      "41": "Furthermore, because you saw the feet and the toes to be part of potter’s clay and part of iron, the kingdom will be divided, but still, from the slip of iron it will take its origin, since you saw the iron mingled with the earthenware from clay.",
      "42": "And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, part of the kingdom will be strong and part will be crushed.",
      "43": "Yet, because you saw the iron mingled with pottery from the earth, they will indeed be combined together with the offspring of man, but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron cannot be mixed with earthenware.",
      "44": "But in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will inspire a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and his kingdom will not be handed over to another people, and it will crush and will consume all these kingdoms, and this kingdom itself will stand in eternity.",
      "45": "In accordance with what you saw, because the stone was torn away from the mountain without hands, and it crushed the earthenware, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God has shown the king what will happen after this. And the dream is true, and its interpretation is faithful.”",

      "48": "Then the king raised Daniel to a high rank and gave him many great gifts, and he appointed him as leader over all the provinces of Babylon and as chief of the magistrates over all the other wise men of Babylon.",

But if you will not adore, in the same hour you will be cast into the furnace of burning fire. And who is the God that will rescue you from my hand?”",

For you are considered as one for ten thousand. Therefore, it is better that you should be in the city to strengthen us.”",

      "14": "And Joab said, “It will not be as you wish. Instead, I will be assailing him in your sight.” Then he took three lances in his hand, and he fixed them in the heart of Absalom. And while he was still clinging to life upon the oak,",

Now at the corners of the columns were diverse engravings. And the spaces between the columns were square, not round.",
