# 📖 Bible Versions JSON Dataset

A free, open-source collection of **35 complete English Bible versions** in **JSON format**, structured by book, chapter, and verse.  
This is the **most comprehensive JSON dataset of complete English Bible translations** available, including popular versions like **NLT, NIV, NKJV, NASB, ESV, KJV, and more**.  
Each translation is stored as its own `.json` file for easy parsing, analysis, app development, or AI projects.

## 🗂️ Structure

Each file represents a single Bible version (e.g., `niv.json`, `kjv.json`, `esv.json`).  
Verses are stored in a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "Genesis": {
    "1": {
      "1": "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
      "2": "Now the earth was formless and empty..."
    },
    "2": { ... }
  },
  "Exodus": { ... }
}
```

This structure makes it easy to:
	•	Iterate through chapters or verses
	•	Build Bible search tools
	•	Compare translations
	•	Feed data into apps, websites, or AI/NLP models


	•	✅ Top-level keys = Book names
	•	✅ Second-level keys = Chapter numbers
	•	✅ Third-level keys = Verse numbers

🧠 Use Cases
	•	Bible apps and APIs
	•	AI and NLP text analysis
	•	Theological research
	•	Cross-version comparison tools
	•	Verse similarity or embedding models
	•	Scripture memorization apps
