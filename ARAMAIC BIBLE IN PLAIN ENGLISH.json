      "4": "But patience will have a complete work for itself that you would be perfected and complete, and that you would be lacking nothing.",
      "5": "But if anyone of you lacks wisdom, let him ask from God who gives to everyone simply, and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.",
      "6": "But let him ask in faith, without wavering, for he who wavers is like the waves of the sea which the wind troubles,",
      "7": "And let not that man think he will receive anything from THE LORD JEHOVAH.",

      "12": "Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been tested, he will receive a crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.",
      "13": "A man should not say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”, for God is not acquainted with evil and he does not tempt a man.",
      "14": "But each man is tempted from his own desire, and he lusts and he is seduced.",

      "22": "But be a doer of the word and not only a hearer, and do not deceive yourselves.",
      "23": "For if a man will be a hearer of the word and not a doer of it, this one is like one who sees his face in a mirror,",

      "7": "And all kinds of animals, birds and creeping things of the sea and of the land are tamed by the nature of humanity,",
      "8": "But the tongue no man is able to tame, this evil which is uncontrolled; It is full of deadly poison.",

      "14": "And they do not know what tomorrow is. What are our lives except a vapor that appears for a little while and vanishes and passes away?",
