      "35": "That day Laban removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats—every one that had any white on it—and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and he placed his sons in charge of them.",

      "41": "For twenty years in your household I served you—fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks —and you have changed my wages ten times!",
      "42": "If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, certainly now you would have sent me off empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and my hard work, and he issued his verdict last night.”",

The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.",

      "43": "You saw the iron mixed with clay—the peoples will mix with one another but will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with fired clay.",
      "44": "“In the days of those kings, the God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, and this kingdom will not be left to another people. It will crush all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, but will itself endure forever.",
