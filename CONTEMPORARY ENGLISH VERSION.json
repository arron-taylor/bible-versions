This land includes the Jordan River valley, the hill country, the western foothills, the Southern Desert, the Mediterranean seacoast, the Lebanon Mountains, and all the territory as far as the Euphrates River.",
      "8": "I give you this land, just as I promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now you must go and take the land.",
      "9": "Right after the LORD commanded us to leave Mount Sinai, I told you: Israel, being your leader is too big a job for one person.",
      "10": "The LORD our God has blessed us, and so now there are as many of us as there are stars in the sky.",
      "11": "God has even promised to bless us a thousand times more, and I pray that he will.",

      "14": "You answered, \"That's a good idea!\"",
      "15": "Then I took these men, who were already wise and respected leaders, and I appointed them as your official leaders. Some of them became military officers in charge of groups of 1,000, or 100, or 50, or 10,",
      "16": "and others became judges. I gave these judges the following instructions: When you settle legal cases, your decisions must be fair. It doesn't matter if the case is between two Israelites, or between an Israelite and a foreigner living in your community.",
      "17": "And it doesn't matter if one is helpless and the other is powerful. Don't be afraid of anyone! No matter who shows up in your court, God will help you make a fair decision. If any case is too hard for you, bring the people to me, and I will make the decision.",
      "18": "After I gave these instructions to the judges, I taught you the LORD's commands.",
      "19": "The LORD had commanded us to leave Mount Sinai and go to the hill country that belonged to the Amorites, so we started out into the huge desert. You remember how frightening it was, but soon we were at Kadesh-Barnea,",
      "22": "Then all of you came to me and said, \"Before we go into the land, let's send some men to explore it. When they come back, they can tell us about the towns we will find and what roads we should take to get there.\"",
      "23": "It seemed like a good idea, so I chose twelve men, one from each tribe.",

      "28": "We are afraid, because the men who explored the land told us that the cities are large, with walls that reach to the sky. The people who live there are taller and stronger than we are, and some of them are Anakim. We have nowhere to go.\"",
      "30": "The LORD our God will lead the way. He will fight on our side, just as he did when we saw him do all those things to the Egyptians.",
      "31": "And you know that the LORD has taken care of us the whole time we've been in the desert, just as you might carry one of your children.\"",
      "32": "But you still would not trust the LORD,",
      "33": "even though he had always been with us in the desert. During the daytime, the LORD was in the cloud, leading us in the right direction and showing us where to camp. And at night, he was there in the fire.",

      "37": "The LORD was even angry with me because of you people, and he said, \"Moses, I won't let you go into the land either.",
      "38": "Instead, I will let Joshua your assistant lead Israel to conquer the land. So encourage him.\"",
      "39": "Then the LORD spoke to you again: People of Israel, you said that your innocent young children would be taken prisoner in the battle for the land. But someday I will let them go into the land, and with my help they will conquer it and live there.",
      "40": "Now, turn around and go back into the desert by way of Red Sea Road.",
      "41": "Then you told me, \"We disobeyed the LORD our God, but now we want to obey him. We will go into the hill country and fight, just as he told us to do.\" So you picked up your weapons, thinking it would be easy to take over the hill country.",
      "43": "I told you what the LORD had said, but you paid no attention. You disobeyed him and went into the hill country anyway. You thought you were so great!",
      "44": "But when the Amorites in the hill country attacked from their towns, you ran from them as you would run from a swarm of bees. The Amorites chased your troops into Seir as far as Hormah, killing them as they went.",
      "45": "Then you came back to the place of worship at Kadesh-Barnea and wept, but the LORD would not listen to your prayers.",
      "46": "After we had been in Kadesh for a few months, we obeyed the LORD and headed back into the desert by way of Red Sea Road."

      "5": "but don't start a war with them. I have given them the hill country of Seir, so I won't give any of it to you, not even enough to set a foot on.",

      "10": "Before the LORD gave the Moabites their land, a large and powerful tribe lived there. They were the Emim, and they were as tall as the Anakim.",

      "13": "When we came to the Zered Gorge along the southern border of Moab, the LORD told us to cross the gorge into Moab, and we did.",
      "14": "This was 38 years after we left Kadesh-Barnea, and by that time all the men who had been in the army at Kadesh-Barnea had died, just as the LORD had said they would.",
      "17": "Then the LORD told me,",

      "22": "The LORD helped them as he had helped the Edomites, who killed many of the Horites in Seir and forced the rest to leave before settling there themselves.",
      "23": "A group called the Avvim used to live in villages as far south as Gaza, but the Philistines killed them and settled on their land.",
      "24": "After we went through Ammon, the LORD told us: Israel, pack up your possessions, take down your tents, and cross the Arnon River gorge. The territory of the Amorite King Sihon of Heshbon lies on the other side of the river, but I now give you his land. So attack and take it!",
      "25": "Today I will start making all other nations afraid of you. They will tremble with fear when anyone mentions you, and they will be terrified when you show up.",
      "26": "After we had crossed the Arnon and had set up camp in the Kedemoth Desert, I sent messengers to King Sihon of Heshbon, telling him that his nation and ours could be at peace. I said:",
